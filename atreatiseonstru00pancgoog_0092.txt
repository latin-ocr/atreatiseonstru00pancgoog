should have produced any effect in the abdominal nerves, inas·
much as these perform the fonction of secretiori, whose action,
if any exista, is not perceptible to our senses.

In the mean time, I willingly admit that I have not the'same
dexterity in physiologica! experimenta which I admire in some
distinguished men3 and Ι ingenuously consess that 1 would place
more saith in their observations than my own. A long time
ago, however, there were experimenta made by celebrated men,
which exhibited the intluenee os the nervos over the heart
Wrrnrs,* whose observatione are conspicuous over the rest, after
the section of the par vagum (which is connected with the sym-
pathetic nerve in quadmpeds) saw the heart immediately begin
to palpitate, and the larger vessels fill with coagulated blood.
Bnuurvrl and Lownnss have noticed the same phenomenon.
Ewsll having lacerated the medulla oblongata, remarks, that
motions were instantaneously produced in the heart, which in-

· ereased the force of the pulse3 and although Hannnn§ has not
confirmed the asserum, yet other and more recent experiments .
support it with much probability. Scrrmucrr, Fowrnn, Psarr,
Lunwro, Cerva, and Wsrrsrna‚ll excited the motion ol the
beart, in animals both os eold and warm blood. The illustrious
Housounr, also, in the fox, rabbit‚ frog, lizard, mady* and gym- ι
notus electricus‚†† restored the action of the heart aster it had
ceased, (that organ being endowed with nerves in these animus)
or rendered its contractioris more vivid, by galvanio excitement,
which he administered with the greatest caution, and in such a
manner as to conve'y it to the heart by animal and vegetable eon·
