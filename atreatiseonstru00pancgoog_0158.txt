Doctor Ennsrsu, superintendant os the anatomical department
os our medical Facultp, has convinced meos the following„ re·

specting the discovery of dacossorv.

ἵ The ganglion of the glossopharyngcal, nervo gives off a con-
spicuous branchlct, which enters through a foramen in the infess
rior 'sade of the pctrous portion of the tempora] bone, into a canal
which is engraved in the hone. This branchlet, when it arrives
at the promontory, is divided into three filamcnts3 the first of
which extends towards the fenestra rotunda; the second, ascends
and is united to the superficial vidian or petrous nerve; the
third, runs sorward, penetrates from the tympanum through the
osseous septum into the carotid canal, and mingles in the ner·
vous plexus, around the carotid artery. .

In one subject the glosso-pharyngeal ganglion received a com-
rnuniosting branchlet from thesuperior cervical ganglion oi the
sympathetic nerve. ’
