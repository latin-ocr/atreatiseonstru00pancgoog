the eardiac nerve of each side.’' But 1 cannot agree with this
illustrious man, when he pronouncea the candiae nerves to be of
ν a very sest, gelatinous characian* 1 have indeed found them
very small and delicate, but not softer than those derived from
other sources. But among the cardias nervcs themselves, there
appeared to me some difference in regard to tbe character of the
distributing branches, viz. that the deep seated. cardian nerves,
situated between the aorta and pulmonary artery, were less
round and ey' f ,and less succulent than tbe rest, but ap-
peared rather When& down and agglutinated to the peri·
etes of the vessels.

ξ 26. The history of the cmdiae nervos now being completed,

we will return to the trunk of the intereostal' nervo, which we ·

relinquished at the first thoracie ganglion

That ganglion which bears a very large share in the produc-
tion of the cardiac plexus, emits, beside the cardine nerves,
some slender filaments to the voluntary musclcs3 vir. to the
inferior part of the longus colli musele.

Another very slender filament· appeared to me to proceed to
the anterior longitudinal fascia of the vertebral column, and ob·
scured hythe ligamentous fibres of the latter *to penetrate into
the bone itself.

§22 The first thoraeic ganglion being completcd, the inter·
coma] nerve is again compressed in siae, and having passed a
short distance, swells out again anew into the second ganglion.
In some subjecte, however, these two ganglia are infiated into
one.† The trunk afterwards descende near the vertebrnl column,
passing deeply along the superior part of the dorsal spine, but
emerging a little upwards, near the last thoracic vertebra.

In each costal interval, the trunk forms a small ganglion,
called from its figure, bordeisorme3 henoc (with the above)
twelve ganglia are formed, of which some, like those of the

† This articulation of the ganglia, also occasionally occurs between the first
thoracic, and the inferior cervical, an instance of which is given in the plato to
which Ι alluded, page 1⁰. In that plate also will be found a good dehneatronof
the cordiae nerves of the right side3 those of the leftuids being necessarily eon*
cealed by the positiones the boda-Pronnaea.
