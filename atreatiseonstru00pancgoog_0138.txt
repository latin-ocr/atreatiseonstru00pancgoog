tion of the vessels, obstruction of the viscera, and genuine or7
ganic diseases. Protracted mental depression arising from thc
sufferings produced by disease at the praecordia, have been known
te give rise to aneurisms of the heart, and very frequently of the
larger vessels. Many unfortunate individuale who have been
pursued by adversity, and losded with an insuperable crowd of
afflictione, have in the course of time become affected with indu-
rations of the epigastric viscera, particularly of the pylorus, and
finally of the pancreas, liver, and spleen. In a love sick girl,
who had sunk under the blighting of her matrimonial prospecte,
Idiscovered a peculiar organic discase of the ovaries3 which it is
my intention to describe in another place.
All the changes of these organa depended primarily upon the
altered state of the nervos, and were undoubtedly dynamio dis-
eases before they degenerated into organis.
b 139. Ι have been fully convinced hythe most attentive ob-
servation of disease, that spasmodic (spasticus) symptoms always
for a considerable time, precede organic alteration.
lst In affectione of the head, every one knows that con'vulsive
movements of the facia] muscles, gritting of the teeth, strabis-
mus, etc, indicate a serious lesion of the brain.
⁸ These symptoms should, Ι think, be enumerated merely as
the prodromi of dropsy of the ventricles, because they arc some·
times treated with the happiest success, which, in my opinion,
can scarcely ever occur, if a collection of water has already taken
place in those canities. The perverted action of the brein, is by
no means circumscribed te the cavity of the cranium3 itis extend·
ed to distant regions of the body, whence organis diseases are pro·
duced. ι After lesions of the hrain,¹ there is undoubtedly a dyna-
mic disorder of tho nervous apparatus of the liver, antecedent to

- the inflammation and suppuration of thatorgan. Various hypothe-
ses have been invented to explain²the connection between the*

hrain and hepatic system, none of which have yet been at all satis· ’

factory. I may with better reason refer it to a communication
of nerves, and chiefly to the communion of tho right par va·
gum with the sola· plexus, by which the cerebrum is connected to
