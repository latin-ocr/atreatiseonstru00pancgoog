ᾗ 104. In animals osa superior order, the motorial and senso·
rial ganglia of the organs are inflated as it were into one system,
die cerebral, in which the gangliformfigure disappears3 so on
the other hand, the organs employed in nutrition are formed into
apeculiar system, in which the primitive arrangement and form
of the ncrves remain, and which (asin the lowest class oi ani·
mals) closely surround the intestinal canal with their branches

ln fishes also, the sympathetic nerve forms a slender filament ”
in which few-or no ganglia are discovered, the Gadus lota ex·
cepted, upon the nerve of which a small ganglion is seen com-
municating with the intercostal nevves.

ln' the amphibiae likewise, the sympathetic nervo is found si-
tuated near the dorsal spine; it exhibits ganglia in the shell,
(Crevier.) In the Batrachiae, and Ophidiae it ascende as a very
sleuder'filament, into the cranium, in union with the par vagum*
whilst it connects together the intercostal nerve.†

In Birds, the intercostal nerve makes its exit from the cranium
with the par vagum and glosso-pharyngeal, communicating with
the fifth and sixth ⁸ 'rs of the cerebrum3 it forms a cervical gan.
glion which is ΜΕ with the eighth and nintb.

The nervous trunk is then interrupted in the neck: but in the
chest there is found a series of thoracis ·ganglia,‡ and the trunk.
