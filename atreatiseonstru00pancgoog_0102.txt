144,Ιί the movement of the blood is continued in the diseased ·
member as before, it depends upon the action of the heart which
. was not affected with the paralysis3 but the capillary circulation
is always weakened3 as is proved by the atrophy of the affected '
part, stagnation of the fluids, oedema, diminished heaf, etc. ad,
The pulse is generally found weaker and less free in the para-
lytic than the sound limb. ad, The experiments upon dogs and
rabbits* by Evnaann Horon, show that the pulsations of the caro-
tid artery are increased when an irritant (as pure alkali) was ap-
plied to the sympathetic nerve. The arteries beat vividly for
three minutas after the contact But no such effect was pro·
duoed by the applicationes the stimulus to the parietes of the
vessels or the par vagum: hence it clearly follows, that the force

and energy of the arteries, do not depend upon their own irrita· ·

· bility, but upon the influx of a nervous principle.

W1Lson Parma having in a similar manner excitcd the brairi*
of frogs by alcohol, a solution of opium, and the infusion of
tobacco, saw most distinctly that the circulation of the blood in
the web of these animals feet was accelerated;† buthe found it
annihilated when the brain and medulla spinalis wore destroyedss

By this means our experimenter fully discovered that the
movement of the blood in the smaller vessels rs under the influ-

' ence of thenervous system.

G. R Tauvrnnnus,ll also, ιιι experimenta upon frogs, per
oeived that the circulation of blood was destroyed ιιι the webs of
their hind feet, after the section of the sciat'ic nervas, but which.
was continued in the anterior feet after theseperves were divided.

There is no doubt, but that these observations' which 'were ·
