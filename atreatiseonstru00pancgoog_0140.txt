flatus, orpneumatoria, is the most conspicuous, (p. 109,) which
ariaco from the perverted action ο1 the nerves. There is no
discsse of the abdomen, the lesions oi the peritoneum not ex-
copied, but in which there is observed a troublesome and sre-
qnent evolution oi gas This is always ascribed, and erroneous·
ly, to dyspepsia, to the retrocession of miliary eruption, to
hystoria, etc.; but the evolutiones flatus is most generally symp-

oi the‘sicls, which it is vain to attempt to describe in words,
such os inquietude, wandering pains, sighs and groans which
they unconsciously utter when asleep, all attest the existence oi
the same affection of the nerves In nearly all diseases, both

because these phenomena (when they do not depend upon hypo·
chondriasis or hysteria) indicate the most serious affection ο1 the
sympathetic nerve

affectione ο1 the sympathetic nerveto be detected by the senses,
yet 1 em convinced, byattentive autopsic researches, that phleg-
masiae positively do occur in that nerve, corresponding to vari·
ous diseases. Hence I em fully convinced, that other organic
