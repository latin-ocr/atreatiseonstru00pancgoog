autopsis, that the medulla of the nerves may be locally nourinb-
ed, increased and modified without the other portion oi the
nervos being affected by the alteration? .

ξ 151. The branchos of the sympathetio nerves have appeared
to have been enlarged in various d'iseases.¹ A. Duscan* bas
noticed a case of diabetes, in which the urinary bladder vves very
much dilated‚ and the sympathetic nerve three or four times
larger than usual, from its ingress into the abdomen tn its termi-
nation in the pelvis. '

I have mysels observed the nerves forming the suprarcnal
plexus, much thioher in discsse, where the· capsulae recales (renes
succenturiati) which vvere more than twice as large as usual,
had degenerated into tuberculous substance. '

There were eight branches sent off from the right semilunar
' ganglion, to the suprarcnal oapsnle os the right side, ancl thirteen
srom thc lest semilunar ganglion, to the capsule ol the lest sido.
All these branches were terminated at the surface os the 'eap-
sules. Ι detected this organic disease inan nnmarried woman
of twenty-five, who had been affected with chronic miliary dis·
ease. The eruption, srom the effect ol a sright she experienccd,
had been repelled from the sursace, after which there arose con·
vulsive spasmsa, analogous to the epileptic‚ under which she finally
sunk. Nothing unusual vvas discovered in the body¹ of this
woman, but the 'aforesaid change in the suprarenal glande, and
the enlargement os the nerves.

purpose, that the nerves may not only be increased in thickness,
but likewise in number. ⁴
