'¹ aud investigate the branchos sent off in the neck from the Inter-
costal nerve.

§Z ln returning therefore to the first cervical ganglion, it is
well to recall to mind, that that body of close sellulas networlr,
ia adherent to the par vagum, and hypoglossal nervas, but with·
out any intermixture of the nervous pulp. Two white and con-
sistent branches are seen to proceed from it, transversely, and
which are enlnrged by a nervous connection from the first and
second cervical nerves. A third, but longer and more slender

. branch, is sent obliqucly downwnrds, and connects this ganglion
. with the anterior descending branch of the second pair of cervi·
cal nerves. A fourth, yet smuller and longer tlran the last,
having given off mnne fine filaments to the rectus capitis major
anticus muscle‚ is united to the third cervical ncrve.
' 'lbere isa connection, therefore, between the first cervical
ganglion, and the three superior cervical nerves, by the means
s of four intermediate anastomosing branches.
” §8. From the sarno ganglion, beside the filament to the
· · tympanum, which is more fully described in the second chapter,
the following branchos emerge.
The first one we discover is red and firm3 it passes upwards,
·· , and is distributed to the belly of the rectus capitis major anticus
· muscle, the inferior part of which it perforates.
The second branchis likewise red, and extends to the pharynx.
'‘,lt' rs divided into three fine filamonts, which are spent upon tho
ulpingo· phnryngeus muscle‚ but first connected by anastomosis,
with the glosso· pharyngeal nerve, and the pharyngeal branchos
of the 'eighth pair. Thus a plexus rs formed, from which some
twigs are sent to the trunk of the external carotid,
The third brooch, which was formerly considered double or
triple, is pulpy, red, thick, and almost pellucid, and called from
this circumstance, mollis: having connected itself with tlre
laryngeal branch of the eighth pair, it is subdivided into five
branches, that proceed forward to the superior thyroid, laryn-
