Althbugh this juice is less usually met with, and less resemble
to the namral structure ol the ganglia than Scarpa thought, yet
I admit with him, that it-serves chiefly to nourish and anoint the
. nervous filaments3 but it should not be considered analagous to
the cerebral substance, as hasbeen done by some anatomists.

Q 35. Though Ι do not believe that the substance of the ganglia
is sihrilar to abac of the hrain, Ι munet deny that I have found
. two substaades in the ganglia, in which Ι agree in opinion with
the distinguished Wuuznn.

In 'the smaller ganglia, for urstance, in the middle cervical, iu
all the fflotacic, (except the first) and in the lumbar ganglia, the
filanientoua networls may be more successfully unsolded. I was
able to separate each oi these ganglia into a plexus, in which the
z· nerbous filaments when magnified by the microscope scemed con-
nected usgdther, like white semi-lucid fillets or fascicles. The
linea directjou and fihrous structure of these fasciolas, constituted
the essentinl characteres the nerve. Adjoining the white ffli-
iorm substance os these ganglia, there is another os acinaritious
''colour, and orbicular figure, tomentose, and irreducible intua
plexus, which I consider the second matter, or substance of the
gahglion,

In the larger ganglia, to wit, in the first thoracic and semiluuar,
tlte greater thickness and density, as well as intertexture of the
bamma of the nerves, rendere this operation more difficult
Nevertheless aster along and continuous maceration, the fila-
mentous substance within the ganglia, which is evidently derived
from the entering uerves, was resolved into delicate white fibrils,
'between which the cineritious matteras an orbicular or globular
form is deposited.* ’

The first cervical ganglion alone, appears to me to vary from
the common rule, as its substance is not divided into filamentous
aud orbicular portione. That ganglion aster thirty days macerae
tion became somewhat sostened, but formed for a long time, a
