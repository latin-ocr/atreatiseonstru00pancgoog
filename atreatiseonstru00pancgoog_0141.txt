was married, aster she had passed her lorty-second year, and be-
come pregnant fifteen months afterwards. She was subjected,
aster the eighth weelr of gestation, to a series of afflictione, under
the excruciating tormenta of which she ultimately died; to wit,
spells of vomiting, the commonest symptom os pregnaney, which
occurred more than thirty times a day, and produced such dis-
trees, that for three months every thing that was talren into the

stomach was immediately rejected: and although every measure
was tried likely to arrest vomiting both internally and externa]-
ly, during the last seven days os her existence, not even a single
drop of the water she swallowed was retained iu the stomaeh.
From these repeated attacks of vomiting, the lauces and interior

Ι of the mouth, became first inflamed and subsequently marthied,

omitting a most setid odour3 the ‘fingers themselves, which the

, .- patient sometimes put into her mouth, were ulcerated srom the

effects of the putrid sanious discharges But the most distress-
ing symptom of all, was a hurning pain in the course of the
vertebral column, and in the lower portion ol the right hypo·
chondrium, which produced several twists in the body and ex·
hausted the strength ol the patient by incessant jactitation, day
and night. The only way in which this pain could be alleviated
for any length of time was, by ‹lry frieti0n3 at first with the
hand, and afterwards with the towel; which ,at last were so fre·
quently repeated, asto excoriate the whole surface Her wretch-
ed existence was finally terminated under the worst form os

. marasmus. Ι carefully examined the body of this female sorty-

eight hours aster death. The cranium appeared to me unu-
sually small, although the individual was not at all deficient
in intellect l removed the cranium, but could detect nothing
praeternaturalia the cerebrum, which, however,I most studious·
ly examined, because this woman had been¹ tortured during
nearly the lwhole period ol her life, with paroxysms of occipital
headache, the severe pain of which could only be removed by -
continued pressure with the hands upon the head, assisted by
large doses of opium. ¹
