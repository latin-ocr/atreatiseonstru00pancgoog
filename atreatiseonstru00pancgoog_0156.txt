extinguish lise by the production of hectic ferera- Ι concluded,
at first, that the nervous branches might be traced through these

¹tumours, but on making an examination, discovered that they “

were most generally captured in these cases. In a tumor si·
tuated upon the lumbar vertebrae behind tte peritoncam, 1
found the origin os the hypogastric plexus which is there form·
ed hy two roots, entirely divided so as to consist of two parts,
, a superior and inferior. ¹The former terminated in aganglilorm
tumor, similar to those which the nerves exhibit, after the for·
mation of- a cicatrix, from the amputationes a limb: the other,
although separated from the former about the space os a finger's
breadth, did not appear either attenuated or shrunken. Ι exam·
ined another tumor ol' the same kind, which extended up to·
warda the epigastric region, and firmly adhered to the lesser
curvatura of the stomach. Both the pneumogastric nerves
were ruptured in this case, os which the right formed a
slightly elongated ganglion, from which three tender filame'nts
- proceeded formed of a substance, which was of nearly the same
character as the tumor in which they run, The patient, a man
lorty-seven years os age, in whom this tumor was lound, was
suddenly seized with cardialgia, and tortured with severe pain
in the spine of the back, and between the scapulae. Obsti-
nate constipation and violent tormina succeeded to these symp- -
toms, under which the sufferer finally sunk in the lapse of seven

weeks. This truly inveterate organic disease was not manifest· ,

ed during its production bya single symptom, until the pneu-
mogastric nerves were forced apart, and finally lacerated by the
daily increasing aize ol the tumor; when the most violent pheno-
mena were developed. It was, no doubt, the vellication os these
nervas, transmitted to the right semilunar ganglion, and to the
trunk ol the right sympathetic nerve, which produced-the in·
tense pains of the abdomen and dorsal spine. ’

ξ 159.· It is not only in individuals ol advanced age that the
sympathetic nerve exhibita organic changes3 itis likewise affeet-

ed with singular alteration in the embryo; from which it appears, ·

that it is obnoxious to diseases at the most tendor period of lise.
