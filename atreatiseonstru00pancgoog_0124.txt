palpitatione 01 the heart, asthmalic paroxysms, inclination to
vomit, cardialgia, vertigo, cold sweat,¹ palsy, etc, which charac-
terise this diseas'e, but the ganglionic system 01 nerves, and the
muscular fibres 01 11ιο intestines under its control? There is cer· -
tainly 00Ι symptom observable 10 this disease, which cannot be
explained by the affection 01 the nerves.

ξ 117. The various spasmodic paroxysms with which patients
000 differently tortured, should likewisc be considered 00 arising
from irritation 01 the nerves. Thus, although 1000ἰο serino, or
0000010100, (hooping cough) is chiefly located 10 the pulmones-y
apparatus, it seems, notwithstanding, 10 extend its pernicious in·
fluence in the caeliac plexuses: 100 whence comes the titillation
01 the scrobiculus cordis, which patients'experience in this dis·
ease, until the occurrence 01 the violent and suffocative convul-
sion which ensucs? ¹

Why do children run about with such 'anxiety previous 10 the
eruption of 0 paroxysm? Why does vomiting so frequently
take place? How does it happen that 010010 convulsions, which
endanger existence, alniost always accompany or succeed the
cough? Can it 01100 these observations be denied, that some dy-
namio 00 vital influence 01 the par vagum and epigastric plexuses ,
invades the cerebral sphere, and 0110010 0 change in its condition?

ξ 118, The praecordial spasm, known 00100 the name 01 00-
3100 pectoris, inconstanti arthritic asthma, sternocardia or
syncopen nnginoaae, seems to me to 0000101 essentially in an 01-
fection 01 the cardiac, and perhaps also 01 the pulmonary nerves.
It attacks the organs'ol the chest: a constriction 01 the thorax
ῃ takes place producing excessive paine, runs transversely out·
words, terminates in the arms, and afflicte the patient with an
inexpressible 00000 01 anxiety. These paroxysms‚ which are
suddenly excited by excessive bodily· exertion, by the excessive

indulgence in 1001 001 alcoholic drinks,'and especially by de· '

pressing mental emoticns, are dissipated by an eructation 01 flatus.
Here we find 0 confirmation 01 the theory which I laid down
above* that neuralgias constantly produce pneumatosis. But the
