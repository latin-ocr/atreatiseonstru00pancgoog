1 was likewise unable to detect in the encephelou any organic
cause of the chronic delirium to which she had been subject, and
which for a very long period had disordered her sleep.

, The neck showed a scrofulous enlargement of the glands,a
complaint very usual with us, but which in no way had caused
injury by pressing upon the blood-vessels

The thoracic viscera were perfectly sound.

The stomach, which the discharges of black vomit that had
occurred in the disease had induced me to believe gangrenous,
exhibited no organic affection: neither in the intestines nor uri·
nary organs could any change of structure be detected. The
livet was the only abdominal viscus that appeared diseased; it
was of a livid colour. In the uterus, which was then in the fisth
mouth of pregnancy, there was no appearance ol discsse, except
alew fibrous tumours in its substance of the size of walnuts.

The neck of the uterus was hard, and perfectly closed at its
externa] orifice, which had prevented me from succeeding in the
efforts Ι had te make to produce abortion‚ in order to get rid ol‘
the continual vomiting in this way, by removing the 'cause
The foetus was healthy and in its naturd situation.

Having removed all the viscera, Ι sought out'the semilunar
ganglia, which I likewise separated from the body, and most
carefully examined in our anatomical amphitheatro. These
bodies were not, indeed, found converted into any foreign sub· -
stance, but were of an intensely red colour, which, by some ex· .
perienced men and distinguished anatomists, to whom Ι corn· ⁴
mnnicated the case, was admitted to be the product of true and ,
genuine inflammation. This inflammation was so obstinatefuthat
the ganglia, after three days maceration in cold water, were⁵but
little altered in colour: Ι then had a drawing made¹ of the right
ganglion, of which areprescntation will be found in Plate IV. of
, this treatise. Its superior part was of alively red3 but the inferior
srom which the mesenteric branches are s'ent off, was os a livid co· ·

glion, appeared to me much broader than usual.

I am strongly led to believe that this singular inflammation of
