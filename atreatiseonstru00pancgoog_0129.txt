§ 123. Each nervous system therefore is obnoxious to its· own
diseases. But themode in which the cerebral and spinal nerves,
and the nerves of the abdominal plexuses and ganglia are affected
by disease,'is the same. As in the various kinds of convul-
· sione, epilepsy, tetanuS, ete, there is disorder in the voluntary
nervos, even when no organic lesion can be discovered in them;
sothe nerves of the thoracic and abdominal viscera, may be af·
fected without any alteration perceptible to the senses. As the
perverted action of the cephalia brain, is reflected with great

„ soree upon the abdomina] brain, so in turn does the latter react

upon, and overwhelm the sormer; and finally asthe cerebral
system when it is stupified as it were by the violence of disease
destroys lise. in like manner Ι believe, an analogous effect takes
plaoe in certain diseases in the solar plexus. It has been long
taught, that sudden deaths take placo in the human body, in three
different ways, by the cerebrum, heart and lungs3 andI would·

’ add to this a fourth, the solar plexus, the sour'ee and contre of ·

the abdominal netues, which when subjected to a sudden con-
cussion or any serious derangement whatever, is affected witha
paralysis, which is speedily followed by death. There aremany
instances in which injurios inflicted externally upon the epigas·
trium, have produced death by their mechanica] effecta* tac· The

cannot be long borne. ad. 'A boy was killed from being struck
by a playmate on the epigastrium witha snow-ball,''which leit
no visible marks on the organa within* ssd. Rovseu, who du·
ring fifty years, taught anatomy at Amsterdam, states that sudden
death may occur srom a concussion of the mesenteric nervos
(solar plexus) without the existence of any lesion in them which
can be detected. 4th. An electrical discharge through the ab·
