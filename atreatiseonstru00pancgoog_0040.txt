ξ. 43. This plexus (hypogastric) having o cempound origin
from the preceding plexus, srom the lumbar ganglia, and
from the trunk os the intercostal nerve of each side, is placed
like abroad fasciculus between the primitive iliac arteries, de-
scepds deeply in the pelvis, and is connected by a few branchos
with the third and sourth sacral nerves: whencee conspicuous in-
terlacing of filaments arise, which in following the branchos of
· the hypogastric ertery extend to the rectum, ureter, urinary blad-
der‚ to the vesiculae seminales in man, and to the uterus and
vagina in woman.

§44 Into the substance ol the uterus whether empty or
grevid nervous filaments seem to be very rarely sent.

I examined with the greatest care thc uterus ol a woman,
dead twelve hours aster parturition‚ but in whichl found no
nerves, srom either the spermatic or hypogastric plexuses‚ al·
though the sanguineous and lymphatic vessels were very distinct.
l availed mysell ol the same opportunity, to examine with the
¹ microscope whether any nervous twigs were connected with the
tunics of these vessels ; but with the closest attention could de-
tect none.
