· As to the omental plexuscs, which are composed of branohes
following the right and lest gastroepiploic artery, I arn inclined
to believe that they appertain to the vessels, and not to the mem-
brane itsels, asWrisberg* hasdeclared3 soris this were admitted,
it would follow, that the peridoneum, which all physiologists
consider insensibleinahealthy condition, received many, though ⁵
minute servent ’ “

On this subject, I agree in sentiment with Wanrnass that the
pleura, pericardium, peritoneum, and lymphatic vessels receive
no nerves contrary to the opinion of many eminent men, that
distinguished dissecter could discover no nerves terminating in
the lymphatis glands3 sometimes, indeed, the small conglobata
glande were periorated with one or more filaments; but these
pmsed out immediately, and terminated at some spot near, sor
which they were destined.
⁴ ς 54. Many nervous branchlets proceed from the ganglia di-
rectly to other parts, beside the vessels and viscera Many go
to the voluntary muscles, viz: to the longus colli, to the inter·
costals, according to Wanrss, and to theM diaphragm. Some
filaments are spent in the vertebral ligamenta, especially in the
lumbar region 3 others following the ramifications of the vessels
appear to enter the bodies of the vertebrae themselves.

§bb ltbehoves us now, to consider more carefully there-
·lation which exists between the nerves and the vessels.

ᾗ It is now universally admitted that the nervous filaments accompany
the ramificetion of the arteries, which in the opinion of many physiologists
