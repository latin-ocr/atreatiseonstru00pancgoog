bouring parts in the different regions of the hody; whence it rs
that they agree best with the nervous plexuses in functional re-
lations, and that a strong analogy exists between these two kinds
of nervom junctions; which is manifest from this, beside other
resemblanoes that small ganglia are frequently interwovsn with
the plexuses 'l'his author denies barma nervos are united, or
mstain a new reticulated composition in the ganglia

He refutes afterwards the opinion of Jonnsron, upon these
grounds: lst‚ That the voluntas-y muscles, for example the dia-
phragm, and the other muscles moving the rihs receive nervos,
froin the spinal ganglia: ad, That the involuntary muscles, aa tho

stomnch, for instance, receive brancbes from the par vagum, upon
’ which no ganglion existe

§92 Scanrn‚† adopting the opinion of Meclrel and Zinn,
essigns a three-sold use to the ganglia3 namely, “of disuniting
the nervos and of intermingling and collecting them again into
new sets. Fer they first separato the nerves, which are then of
some siae, divide tlrern into many smaller filoments, and inclino
them at various angles, and in different directions, so that they
may be considered as arising commodiously from tho same por-
tion of the tantuli, to be distributed to many parts of the body,
