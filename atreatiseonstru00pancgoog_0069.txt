ln general we may receive this as a constant and well estab-
lished law, that the larger the ganglia, the *less there isos the
globulo-cineritious mattcr3-the smaller, the more of· this latter
substance existS, which is then cf a deep yellow colcur. ι

All the spinal ganglia possess this substance.

ᾧ 86. In regard to the vessels of the ganglia, it is well known,
that they are derived from the arteries and veins of the neigh·

boring parts. Thus, the superior cervical ganglicn receives
branchos from the interna] carotid‚ by thc ascending pharyngeal τ
artery and vein, &cz the middle cervical ganglicn from the infe·
rior thyrcideal artery: the first thoracic from branchos arising'
from the subclavian: the remaining thoracic ganglia from the ’
interccstal arteriesand veins: the semilunar ganglia from the
phrenic, suprarenal, &c , h

When a ganglion possesses many cemes, which enter or de·
part from it, each nerve is attended by an arterial and·'¹vencus
branch, that seem to participate in its composition. . ³

ln examining into the vessels of the superior cervical ganglicn,
Iperccivcdanetwcrk* situated in the second involucrum proceedss ·
ing from lour small trunks. The smaller vessels which run in
the length cf the ganglion were nearly all filled with ared wax
injection. As is common in other situations we also sometimes
'find in the ganglia two veins to an artery.

Some other small branchos which perforate thc second involu-
crum, were discovered when the substance of the ganglicn was
separated from its timics. These at first sight appeared like ared
pulp‚† which, under the microscope, seemed tc have innumerable
ramilications in the same directicn as the filamcnts which com·
