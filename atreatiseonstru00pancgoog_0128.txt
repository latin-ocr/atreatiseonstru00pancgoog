which is not yet fairly developed, often lies concealed under the
form of apaamodic affectione of the hypochondria; and it appears
to merit our particular attention, that the genuine hypochondriae
affectione when long protracted, are finally removed by an atuck
of gout; whilst on the other hand, arthritis itself is capable of
· producing the miliary discsse: hence it becomes evident, that
therela some affinity 'between the merely nervoua diseases of
the¹ahdomen and arthritis and miliary fever.

ξ lea. In reflecting upon the nature bf intermitteret seuera, 1
have thought that it might perhaps he found in the disorder and
perverted action of the abdominal nervous system, and there
appear indeed to be sufficient grounds to render this opinion pro·
bable; 111 The cases of this disease are very rare, in which the
fonctions of the abdominal'organs continue vigoroos, and entire·
ly unaffected: ud. The commencement ol the paroxysms is ol'ten
marked with vomiting: ad. We experience daily, that this dis·

caseis mitigated‚ and very often entirely removed by theuse . ,

of cathartica: 4111. A single emetic‚ when given previously, somo-
times suppressos the paroxysm, and not unusually removes the
whole disease; from which it appears that this remedy makes an
impressius upon the solar plessai of an opposite naturate that
which had produced the sever. oth. When the discsse is either
left to itself or maltreated, congestione are produced in the abdo-
minal viscera, induration of the liver‚ intumescenceof the spleen,
etc, and the general morbid state is changed into a topical affec·
tion. This metaptosis appears to me to prove that the morbid
action, prevails at first in all the plexuses, and afterwards mi-
grates from one to another. For it is first apparently dissemi-
nated in the whole territory of the ganglicnfc system, before it
ntus with much impetus into a single plexos, which is com·
monly the splenic; and as the vessels are under the influence of
the nerves, it cannot be otherwise than that congestione should
thus be produced in the vessels: 6111. 1111 paroxysms ol inter·
