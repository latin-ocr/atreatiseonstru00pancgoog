It is ..very prcbable that a small artcry and vein, attends each
herroris-filament aa is observed in the larger branches of the
' nerveffi upon which no doubt, the rod colour peculiar to the
ganglia depende. ·

:a c'l'he calna arc somewhat differently circumstanced from the
arterias. For the former when examined in the superior cervical
⁴ ganglronand filled with a green substance appear in the form of
aplexus at the superior part of the ganglion, from which many
small branches descend, some transversely, while others run in
'the 'direction of the ganglion.‡
’ As to the lymphatic vessels Ι have frequently observed their
meshes surrounding the ganglia, especially the first thoracic; but

lia, chrrar' instituted v'arious chemical experimenta, from which
he drcw the following inferences. ll

The parenchyma of the ganglia has nothing in common with
thc substance of the hrain. This latter is soft and semiduid‚ con·
s densed with acidsand alcohol‚ but not changed into acoriaceous
substance3 whilst, on the contrary, the gangliaare crisped like the
solids and acquire the greatest consistence.

·By boiling, the ganglia are at first indurated, hut in the course
'ot half an hour become sostened. Alkalies act with much power

upon the ganglia, and gradually dissolve them, but not instanta-
, neously as occurs only in the medulla of the hrain. Wurznn§
after having repeated these experimenta on amore extensive
scale confirms the existence of this difference between the sub·
stance of the ganglia and the cerebral mass. Itis found also that

the ganglia differ from the nerves in the greater abundance of
