This agrees with my own observatione in the human foetus, in
which the ganglia snd nervous branches,is we except the semi·
lunar ganglia, appear more perfect than in adulto.

b 107. According to a corollary‚ of the greatest importauce,
there existsa relation between the sympathetic nerve and the

par vagum3 to wit, that one may take upon it the functions of the '

other. For iu the inferior vertebrated animala, the parvagum
appears to bs the more prolific in' branchos distributed to the in·
lestines ss the sympathetic nerve is less3 and it is found that in
some invertebrated animals no sympathetic nerve existo at all,
and in which its functions are performed by the par vagum only.
Whence lt follows, that the par vagum should be classed under
the same law as the sympathetic itself, with the nerves of vege·
urive life

· Infine, in all orders of animala, the sympathetic nerse is always
found in regard to its developemcnt, to correspond with the
pre-existing vascular apparatus ; which proves that it owes its de·
· licate construction to'the wants of the vessels.

ς 108. Every thing that has been said on this subject, having
now been attentively considered, it cannot be otherwise than
that the great importance ol the sympathetic nerve must tran·
scend that of the rest, in the animal organism.

A nervous system which exists in the lowest scale of animala,
· is peculiar to the nutrient organa, and performs especial functions
of its own3 which prior to the appearance of the brain, constituted
a nervous contre, and which when the cerebral¹ceutre is formed
·in animale, is inter-connected only, and never'composes with it
one undivided apparatus, but always retains its pristine form and
habit3 that such a system is endowed with the greatest functional
importancs is aelf-evident.

ξ 109. Onthe otherhand, those physicians who have proved the
most sagacious observersof natiue, have declared from the remo·
test periods, that there is a being and principle (ens et principi.
um) located in the back part of the epigastrium‚ which they con·
