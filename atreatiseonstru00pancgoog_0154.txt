lumbar plexus remained unimpaired, although they were con-

encysted tumours, etos, 1 have found the nerves apparently
chrunlren, dryer and flatter than usual, and applied upon, or
agglutinated to the tumours3 and in abscesses upon the dorsal
spine, produced by caries of the vertebrae,l have seen the nerves
entirely destroyed.
