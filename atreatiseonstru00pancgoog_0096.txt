, been carefully exanined, it will now be easy to investigate its
sanctione and use.

lst. The sympctltetr'c nervo presides ouer tlte sanction os
nutritios, not only because it imparts many nerves to the chy-
lopeietic organs, and sustains their energy and intluence, butbe·
nauscit isalso distributed to the arterias, which carry the uu·
trient blood ,

Let us suppose the nervous power destroyed in the abdominal
plexuses: theloneos the demach, gastric and intestina] diges-
tion, and the fonctions os the liner and spleen, would be impaired.
'l'hat this indeed may take place, is taught by numberless instan-
ces of mental disease, which when thrown upon the solar plexus,
,suddenly disturbs the whole functiones digestion.

'l'he abnormal aetion of the abdominal nerves, exereises an inss '
fluence over the organs, in regions very distant srorn each other,
from which it is manifest, -that the functions of assimilation and

nutrition arc under its subjection. Recently one of my intimate ,

friends, who is about thirty years ol age, after being suddenly ter· ’
rified by the burning os his house, had his hair to turn white in the
course of a fewdays. Wasitnotthementalsufferingheexperienced
which by the unanimous consent of physiologists‚ deranges the
abdominal nervos, thatin this case produced the change by dis·
ordering the force and functions of these nervos? and did not this
disordered aetion effect the nutrition of the capillaries?
Physiologists have long since acknowledged the great influenee

of the nervas, over the capillary and nutrient vessels. Thus, if
itis enhanced, the action ol the latter is inereased3 is diminished‚
weakened3 is ,utterly deficient, destroyed: hence it is as they are
maintained to supply this office, they have not any control be-
yond it Is it not then evident that when the nerves are iujured

nutrition would be frequently ldpstroyed? The asperimonts ol
