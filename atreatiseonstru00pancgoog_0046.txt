vidian nervo. It opens into the cavity ol the tympanum above
the promontory. Then passing bacliwards in the form os a curve
descendo upon the promontory near the fenestra rotunda, and di·
vides into two small canals, the first ol which extends toa small
foramen in the carotid canal, and the other opens at the baseos
the cranium near the receptacle sor thc glosso-plmryngcal nerve.

b. 51. ΗΔιιΕιι* once saw the whole intereostal nervc con·
tinued into the splanchnic, as none existed at the sixth rib ς but
it was again produced oi customary aize, srom new roots below
the seventh rib. Brcnsrl assumes this obseruatiou which he
confirmed, as thcprincipal foundation of his theory, in which he
does not consider the sympathetic nervo as a continuous trunk
from the head to the pelvis. But Wursnuno‡ has pronounced
this observation of Hamus an anomaly, and not at all to bc con· ·
sidered as thc usual structure3 which opinion as thc result ol
much investigation, I would strenuously maintain. lhavo also
the concurrence of the skilful Wenea, 11 who has great doubts of
thc truth ol that observation.

In thc tenth intercostal interval, thc sympathetic nerve also
appears occasionally to terminate.

If there bc no continuation of thctrunk, it posses over the
small head of the eleventh rib, to the twellth, as is usual in other
places. But when a more carelul examination is made, its di-
rection is found so changed that the lowest root os the splanchnic
ner-ve as it expands over the body ol the eleventh vertebrais
the true continuation os thc trunlr, accompanied bya 'peculiar
branch lrom the spinal nerve, between the eleventh and twellth
dorsa] vertebrae, and afterwards having resumed its route posses
onward to the abdomen.

ι 'l'he celebrated Pournnb indeed asserts that hc has never seen
the sympathetic nerve interrupted in its thoracic portion.
