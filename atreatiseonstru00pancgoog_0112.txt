vous atmosphere about the nerves and muscles, as was proved
uom experimenta by the celebrated Hunnorum* This gas, I
believe, is conducted into the intimate structure os the organo, is

mixed with the deepest seated os the fluide, and, although the

minata or disappear from the view, yet this vapour, in my own
opinion ut least is effused into the cellular texture, penetrales to
every point ol the organa, and, if 1 be allowed the expression, fills
them with its own atmosphere. This vital nervous halitus or vu-
pour islikewise introduced into the bodies of the vertebras bytner·

The reasons which induce me to admit a peculias gos in the
nerres, arise irum the multifarious phenomena that occur in the
anund and disessed states of the body.

A. lst. In regard to the former, (the sound state) I think that
all vital turgescence may -be considered as arising chiefly from
a psychological cause The sudden reducas oi the face, arising ·
from mental excitement, does not certainly depend upon a gene-
ral affection ol the nervous end sanguiueous systems, hut upon a
topical action ol' the nerves. The capillary vessels os the skin
ate here suddenly dilated3 the blood is expanded toa volume
and extent greater in proportion to the nervous principle mixed
. with it, and which produces the same effect upon it as caloric in
hoiling water. The same phenomenou occurs in the turgescence
or erection of the genital organs, which is repidly aud often solely

frum an increased action of the beart. Hence it is manifest why
