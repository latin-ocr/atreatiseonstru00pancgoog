which proceed from' tbe lest side of the body„ It is lilrewise the
more necessary toindieate thern, as the nerves of botb sides most
frequently'run together upon tbe base of tbe beart, and bave a
close connection with eaeb other. Ι .

In examining accordingly with the greatest care, the subject ' ’
above described, the origin and course of tbe nerves belonging to
the left side of tbe beart, appeared as follows.

N o superficial cardias nerve existed, either from the superior
cervical ganglion or tbe eigbtb pair. But the middle cervical
galtglion sent off every conspicuous strong filament, which de·
scended behind tbe carotid artery, and having formed an anasto-

' » On the contrary the first thoracic ganglion, supplied the cuper·
ficiat cordiae cerne which descended indeed behind tbe sub
clavian, but sent small superficial branchos to tbe carotid artery
and acrba
An inverse relation therefore clearly existe in the origin and
disposition of the cardiac nerves of tbe left and right side. ·
The principa] cardine nerve in its ulterior distribution descende
towards tbe baseos the beart, upon which it is received between
the concavity of the aorta and the left brancb of the pulmonary
artery. · An anastomosis is then formed between tbis cardiac

· nerve and the collateral cardine nerve of the right side.

¹Afterwards it is divided into two principal branebes: the first
of which ¹²pr externnl, having anastomosed with the posterior
, brancb of the right deepseated cardiac nerve‚ gives-off three or
four small branebes to the left pulmonary artery. The secondor
intercal, apparently a continuation of tbe trunlr, situated deeply

lbetween tbe aerta and pulmonary ancxy, again divides into three
rancbes.
