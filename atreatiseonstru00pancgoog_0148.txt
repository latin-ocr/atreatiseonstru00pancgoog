so during several years3 emaciation and debility subsequently
occurred, and linally,¹ another attnek of asthma uras developed
which harassed the patient by day and night. For many months
she was unable to breathe‚ save in the erect posture, had a small
, and very irregular pulse, a pallid lace, speech checked through
„ sentos suffocation, oedemaof the feet, obscure and pulsatile move-
rnents in the upper part ol the left sidens the thorax, and pain in
the humerus of the same side, all which indicated the existence
ol organis discsse in the lungs and praecordia, which was con-
sidered at one timeto consist in hydrothorax, at another in con·
gestion oi the lungs, and subsequently in a discsse of the heart
or. larger vessels. The use ol antispasmodics aggravated all ⁸·
these symptoms. Venesection alone afforded relies, which was
however but os a few hours duration. This woman finally died

in the clinica] institute ol this city, with all her mental sunctions Ι
unimpairod.

Upon opening the body, a large quantity of serum was found
in the right cavity of the thorax; the lungof the same side had

suffered the, broncdopurisorm induration, the left long was
shrunken, there was also dropsyof the pericardium, and the cavi-
ties of the heart were dilated so as to form what is called passive

aneurism: the parietes of the anterior ventriole, were extremely ’

thin, scarcely two lines thick. The pulmonary artery²·which
was very much dilated, was an inch and nine lines in diameter: its·
orifice was an inch broad. The diameter of the aorta at its ori·

fice was very little above seven lines; but immediately aster its ¹

· origin, it was dilated into a vast sac, two inches and seven lines
in diameter. The adscititious tunic ol this artery sormed of the
reflected pericardium, was thickened, whitish and changed to a
cartilaginous consistence3 between the other tunics there existed

numerous osseous scales3 but there were no ossifications or stony ’

incrustations discovered in the semilunar valves of either lhe
nortio or pulmonary arteries, in the fleshy rings which separate
the ventrioles from the auricles, nor even in the valves of the
ventrioles. But the principa} diseaae we met with in these
places, was nn aneurinn srising hom the oonmvity ol the arch
