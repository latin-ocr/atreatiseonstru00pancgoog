pair which leads to the orbit sd, Its division near its anasto- ’
mosis, which furnishes additional prees that it proceeds towards
the ganglion. dd, Lastly, the union ol this same braneh in a
common fasciculus with the sixth-pairoi nerves, (motor externus)

But the whole os this question is vain and idle at the present
time, when that portion of the Sympathetic nerve, concealed in
the earotid canal (as the expression runs) is no longer considered
its origin.

ᾗ 3. The Sympathetie nerve having passed out of the carotid
canal, appears at first as a sel't, red suuiele. Asterwards it
enlarges into the superior cervical ganglion, denominated srom
its figure, olieory.

I have scen this ganglion twenty lines in length, and three in
diameter: in another subject, and upon both sides it was thirty·
leur.

Itis siluatcd upon the superior part, and towards the external
margines the rectus eapitis major musele, covered at first above

Ι by the internal earotid artery, in frout of which, however, it

'¹ quiekly appears. Anterior to it descende the Glossopharyn·
geel norve; and exterior, and a little posterior to it, lies the
internal jugular vein, the par Vagam, and last os all the Hypo-
glossal nervo.

I have found the uppcr cervical ganglion double. The trunk
ol the Sympathetie nerve in this ease immediately after having
left the earotid eanal, separated into two parts, one internal, and
the other external, which communicated together by branehes oi
considerable size.

That which may be ealled the interior ganglion, was fifteen
lines long and three in diameter. The exterior ganglion was an
inch long and three lines thick, and was joined with the Hypo·
glossal nerve, by two anastomosing branchos The brauches
which were sent downwards by this double ganglion, united
· into a single eord, about the middle ef the neck, and constituted
the trunk ol the Sympathetic nerve.

Of the internal composition of the ganglia, I shall treatforther
on; When, too, 1 will more earesully investigate the condition,
