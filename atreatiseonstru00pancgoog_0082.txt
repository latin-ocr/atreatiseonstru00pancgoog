sd together, not according to their peculisr lawa, und composea

system, separate from the animal sphere, over which appropriate

laws preside ·
This system also possessos the faculty ol perception3 namely,

ι it receives impressions, and rescts upon them ; but this percep·
tion abides in its own region, and is not communicated to the
brein. In a healthy state the system oi ganglia, exerts no mani-
fest influenee upon the cerebra] system, from which it is divided
hythe separatory or isolotr'ug apparatus, (the series of gan·
glis in the sympathetic nerve.) . -

. But the case is different iu a state ol' disease, for when the vital
encrgy is increased in the communicating nerves of the plexusee
the condition oi the ganglia is changed3 they transmit impressione
which the extremities of the nerves in the viscera receive, and

Ι become modestum, whilst before they were uon condoctore or

isolutors.

This occurs spontaneously in certain generg of diseases of
which we shall spealr in the third section of this treatise. But
there isa certain mode and means discovered, by which the se·
paration between the animal and vegetativespheres may be over-
come, and an intercourse instituted between them, or rather the
two systems may apparently be united into one. By the in-
tluence ol animal magnetirm which is falsel'y and to the great
detriment ‘oi physiology, considered as deceptive by super·
scial observem, it is most certain that the animal sphere may be
extended even to the inmost recesses of the organs, so that alree
’ intercourse shall occur between the cerebrum and solar plexus.
'l'here exist innumerabis experiments tswhich prove that those
stunned to sleep by magnet ic tinfluenoet through the epigsotrum,
that rs through the solar plexus ast the centre gi the vegentive
sphere have seen and heard: aud why? Because the impediment
nbsisting between the two nervous spheres, being broken by the
hagnetic influence, and every obstacle removed, acontinuous
route rs laid open between the seat of the common sensorium sud
the obdor'ninsl plexuses, and il Ι may be sllowed the ligure, the
cerebrum itsell rs immersed m the epigsstriups
