as it now excites the attention os many distinguished men.

We will commencc with a description os ench branch, end

ᾗ. 19. The principol cordiae cerm which Wnrssnre* calls
mamimus or novus, es it arrives at the origines the arteria inno·
minata, swells into agrrrrglion, that may be called the cardias,
from which three branches emerge in different directions, viz.
abierim, posterior and middle: This last from its thickness aod
direction is considered the continuation os the trnnle

The first ef these branches, the anterior and right, is of consi-
derable size; is reflected round the sorta tcthe posterior surfsce ei
which it seems at first agglutinated, posses into a sulcus between
the base of the right ventricle and rightenricle, and forms cn snes-
tomosis vim the right braneh ol the left cnidiae nerve, by which
a kind of coronetpp formed mound the hese of the corta. Then
after having received the filaments from the lest cerdice nervc, tt
gives off two escending branchos to the auricolor appendix of the
right sinus, which evidently go to the musenlsr fibres. It after·
warde attends the right coronery artery in its course, divided inte
two branches, which ere placed between the trunksos'the artery.

All the ramificstions which proeced irem these branches, form a
lesser plexus which may be properly denominated the right cosr-
