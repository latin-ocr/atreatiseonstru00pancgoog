From this we may conclude that the filamenta 01 the laryugeal
ucrve, in the case described are osa mixed character, partly
101111011 by the par vagum, aud partly by the intercostal nervc.
This arrangement is particularly important, in regard to that
branch 01 the laryngeal nerve‚ which is given 011 near the origin
01 its own trunk, and received afterwards upon the external caro· .

connected evidently with the superior cervical ganglion by a ’
yellow semilueid nervous pulp, which the microscope places
beyond all doubt, passos immediately 10 the basis 01 the larynx,
and is spent upon the erico-thyroid musele, after having sent
¹ forward three twigs 10 the thyroid gland.

But in some subjects, I have seen this branch 01 the laryngeal
nerve, proceeding 11010 the cervical gauglion to 1110 erico-thyroid
muscle and thyroid gland, without any connection with the pan·

§ 10. For whatever may be the origin, number, 01 diversity,
01 these nervas, and the inconstancy 01 their natural division
