it escapes, adepraved imponderablc character, which takes place
in the following manner in these diseases: lst It escapes with,

sometimes the blood is eliminated by the exhalent vessels, pro·

is retained in the rete mucosum of Mnnrrsm, destined for the
protection of the nervous papillae, and elevates the epidermis '
into chrystalline vesioles called miliary, which are more often
filled with gsseous than serous fluid.

On the other hand, there are various idiopathic affections of
the nerves, of the spasmodio kind, in which this gaseous fluid is
evolved in abundance. This class consiste of the hypochondriao
and hysteric effections, angina pectoris, nervous apoplexy, etc ¹

I receive it as fixed, that in the paroxysms of these diseases,
the nervous pulpis saturated with the peculiar principle it bears, 2
the mode of aetion of which is such, thstwhen it is rapidly added
to the secreted humours, it escapes from the body as the patient ⁴
recovers, or with his destruction if the nervous fluid is mingled
with the blood. Every one knows tlrat the paroxysms ol hypo·
chondriasis and hystoria, angina pectoris, etc. are dissolved by a
eopious eructation of flatus, whilst in the species of apoplexy re·
ferred to, aerial bubbles have been found enclosed in the vessels
of the brein* Hence it is unusual to meet with a neuralgic al· ·
fection os the nervous system, and especially of the sympathetic

aerial fluid or true pneumatosz's. ¹
