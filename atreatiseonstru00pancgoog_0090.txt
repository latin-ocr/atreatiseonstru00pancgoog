the trunlm orratherismoved with the greatest celerity. lst'l'here
is nothing to prevent the numerous nerves which run to the mus-
cular fibres of the beart, stomach, intestines, diaphragm, and an·
terior muscles of the neck, from having the same relation with
these parts, as the nerves emanating from the hrain, have with
the voluntary muscles. In these nerves, the principle which
excites motion, proceeds from the trunk into the branches. 2d.
In regard to the similarity of the retrograde motion of the sym·
pathetic nerves with that of the cerebral hervee, we have this,
certain, that the numerous branchos which terminate in the in-
ternal membranc of the stomach, intestines and excretory ducta,
which parts they furnish with sensibility, return the impressione

they receive (as for instancein the whole tract of intestines) in the
aforesaid retrograde manner to a certain centre, as these are re-
turned by the cerebral nerves to the organs of the senses3 there is
this difference however between them, that impressions, which in
the natural state, arisc in the viscera, and terminate in the ganglia,
in certain cases (which are soon to be pointed out,) ascend into

the brein itself‚ are perceivcd there, and excite an obscure sen-
sation in the mind.

But the branchos of the sympathctic‚ belong principally to the
arterias, which they envelope, while the finest filaments which
follow the arterial branches into the organs, arc terminated in
their external coat Hence it is manifest that the vessels are
primitively constituted under the government of the nerves, and
that from them, the force and energy are horrowed, with which
they operate in the functions of nutrition and secretion. I sus·
pect also, that the nervous power in organs, which the arteries
enter, is diffused, as it were by the cellulas structure, in which
the nervous filaments vanish: by this arrangement the intimate
suucture of the organs, is placed as it were, in or penetrated hya
nervous atmosphere.

Some observors have subjected the sympathctic nerve to
· ⁵ physiological experiments in living animals, in order to investi· ·
gnte its vital properties.

These experimenta have been variously tried, especially since
