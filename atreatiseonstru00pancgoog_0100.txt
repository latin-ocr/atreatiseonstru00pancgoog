Many branchos of nerves that advance from each side os the
body to the beart, and are arranged in remarkable plexuses which
attend the eoronary arteries, do not appertain to the vessels as
the celebrated Smuunarue and Bennnuns thought, but are evi·
dently chiefly terminated in the ,muscular substance os the beart.
What should we inser from that fact? This certainly! that, the
cardiac nerves have tlie same relation to the fibres of the heart, as
the cerebral and spinal nerves with the voluntary muscles. I
admit and it follows from the physiological experiments related,
that there is some difference between these two classes os nervos,
from this reason principally, that the former when irritated bya

foreign stimulus do not produce the same virid movement in the ,

beart, as occurs in the voluntary muscles. But it cannot be in·

* On comparing the‘ results os the experiments made by Wilson Philip, Bm·
die and Broughton,the sollowin conclusione may be drawn.

‘⁶ lst. The simple section of epneumogastric nerves in the neck without
, loss of substance, and without alter' the itinn os their extremities, does
not prevent digestion from being pe orme ; it only retards itin a very evi-

dsnt manner-⁴

diffliiiff the digestive action if the stomacb, but does not appear entirely tc

‘a sd. The division or destruction of the lowest· part of the spinal marrow, or

ue removal os a rtion of the brein is productrve of the same effecte, as to the

alteration which ood undergoes in the stomach.
