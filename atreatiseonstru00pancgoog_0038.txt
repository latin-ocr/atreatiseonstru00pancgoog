l am well acquaintcd with the ncrvous intertextum ol' which
Wanrss speaks, and which is ehietly formed hy filamcntslrom
the intercuslal hunlr3 but it emits no rasnilrcations peculiar te
the spermatic vessels.

§- 38. As respecta tlresuprerenal plemam have enume-

rated eight ncrvous branchos, which extend to the (right) suc-
centuriata kidney (capsula renalis) three ol' which proceeded
from the senrilunar ganglion and five from the renal plexus.
· The coense ol these nerves was in aright line, not dividcd or
connected together by anastomosis, before they entered the
. gland (capsula renalis 3) they did not closely embraec the arte-
ries which they attended, but were very loosely united to their
cellular eoat

These ncrvous branchos are generally white, not red nor solt,
but quite firm. They arc not less in diameter than the arteries
themselves ς sometimes indeed they seem larger.

There arc some things vvorthy ol note, respecting the ncrvous
plexuses of the abdomen as well as the branchos os the greater
and'lesser splanchnic ncrves. At present the order of this bea-
tise leads us back to the hunlr ol' tlre intereostal, where we last
oarelully examined its course and ramilrcations.

ἦ. 39. Two splanchnic nervos having been given off, the trunk
itself penebates inte the abdomen through its own hiatus be-
tween the second and third fasciculi os the crura ol the diaphragm.
It descends upon the sides of the bodies ol the lumbar vertebrae,
in a direction towards their anterior part, whence the more
remote it is srom the intervertebral foramina, the longer arc
the anastomosing branchcs, between it and the lumbar nervas:
but when it has arrived at the pelvis, it again approximates the
formnina of the sacrum, and finally reposes at their margin.

It receives inita course, from each of the lumbar nerves, two or
three branches which descend obliquely upon the sides of the
vertebrae, and where they touch the sympathotic nerve serm
small ganglia, generally os a flat compressod figure srom which
filaments shortly to be described, proeecd to tho organa.
