'l'he latter on the contrary is not collected into an'y cenna: it-
has no single locus of action, but exercises ita functions over a
wide suriaco. 1t connects the organs together in three different
modes. ᾖ

lst. 1t forms networlrs around the vessels, which embrace the Ι
siderios with-their slender and minute branchlets, (as the iry
elasps the stem of atree) and penetrates with them tothe organs.
These networlts are known under the name espleausn, twelve
of which ars enumerated, appertaining to different parts. One
however is particularly conspicuous, placed in the back part ’ ·
of the epigastrium‚ and furnished with ganglia, from which·
branchos proceed to the abdominal viscera forming secondary
plexuses: this plexus (solar) has a long time been considered by'
physiologists, as acastre or abdomina! braim

ad. These plexuses are connected to the brain, and medullal
spinalis, by branchos which an calls conductore. Thus tho'
renal nervo and the greater and lesser splanchnic are the condncss '
tors of the plexuros, and also the cardian nerves which ascend·
from the cardiac plexuses to the region of the neck.

The funicle itself which is stretched outlongitudinally near the
dorsalspine, and known astho intereo-stol narce, receives these ⁸ .
conductors, and connects them with the cerebral system, whilst
on the other hand it circumscribes as it were each ganglionic sys- ,
tom, and separates them from themerebral sphera. The two' ¹
triurlss os the sympathetic nerve, united below by the madiumot Ι
the coccygeal ganglion, or a nervous loop, and above by tlte
brain likewise through the intervention of the fifth and aixth
cerebra] pairs, form a circle in returning upon themselves or
raher- ffellipsis which incloses the whole system of ganglia'and
plexuses Of the cerebral nerves the fifth, sixth, glosscphcsyns* a
geal, pneumogastric and hypoglosml are immersed in this spirens.

sd. These branches, the conductors of the placasses, appeac w
forma perfect connection between the animaland vegetatis*
. systema, every commotior which theldwer viscera suffer, would
be conveyed to the sensorinm commune, and vioe amsa, the will
