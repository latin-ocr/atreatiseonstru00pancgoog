and seat of which exist in the abdomen.

The symptoms are innumerable which are openly manifested
between the head and theviscera os the abdomen, however great
may be the harmony existing between these organs: for a thou·

· viscera,·either dynamio or organic, which does not sometimes
sympathetically effect the head.

passes off in vehement pains, and spasms of the occiput, extend-

yond the orbit, and suffers greatly by ¹exposure to light ; the pupils
are contracted, the tears tlow in streame, the palpebrae become of
ashiningredness, and serum is discharged in considerable quanti-
,ty from the nostrils. It is easily understood how these symptoms
are produced in the various diseases of the abdomen: sor we find,
as is displayed in the anatomical section of this treatise, that
there is a very intimate communication of the sympathetic '
nervos, with the fifth pair, par vagum and cervical nerves5 The
intercostal nerve therefore, or the par vagum, being affected in
the abdomen, the irritation accruing from this cause, readily
rises into the nerves of the head, where it excites pains and
spasmo, which take place the more readily, as there gene·
