by the cerebral and spinal nervcs, to the volunmry muscles Ι.

In the foetus none but the sympathetic nerve is in vigorous ae·
tion, it existe previous to the secretory and nutrient 'organs3 it
msmins the energy of the heart; and breaks in sometimes upon
the cerebrnl sphere, and determines those autumatio motions,
which the infant when enclosed in the uterus performs with its
‚musolea ncephdous foemses, destincte of cerebral and spinal

medulla, and hence wanting the mous nenne, from which ema· ·

nates the principle of muscular curtractions, perform, neverthe- .
less, musculas movements which ean be in no other yvay excited
than by the vital influence of the sympathetic nerse, which is
joined by anastomosis, with the spinal nerves.

During the extra-uterine lise of man, when there existe some ¹

intermediate internal sense inherent to the stomaoh, this nerve ·
forms a remarkable intercourse between the cerebrum, and the
viscera os the thorax and abdomen, as is proved by numberless
phenomena. Then, asin the embryo and loetrrs, it governs the
system os capillary vessels, and directe the functione ol assimila·
tion and nutrition, thmugh the influence of the vital plestic power,
which Baourssars calls vital chenristry.
