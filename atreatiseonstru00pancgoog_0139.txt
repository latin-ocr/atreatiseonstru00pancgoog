tud. Aneurisms of the heart exhibit preparatory symptoms
depending upon irritation of the nervas, especially when they
originate from gouty affectione, and are slowly formed.

The heart is often, for along time, subjected to palpitation
and nemora, or nervous oscillations, hetone itis affected with
' the gannim form of dilatatiou.

ᾖ ard. The morbid affectione are very diversrfied which precede

the alteration of the lungs The patient is often, for many
years, obnoxious to spasmodic attacks, to which at length super·

from the heart, as occurs, for instance, in many esses of angina
pectoris I have likewise seen some forms of phthisis, thatin
their incipient stage, presented no symptoms but those ol abdo·
minal neuralgia3 viz. paroxysms ol hypochondriasis, dyspepsia
and swelliug os the hypochondria„ The lungs, iu these indivi-
duals, seemed along time absolutely unaffected3 so that, from all
- appearances, it might have been said, that the general and nerv-
ous affection was suddenly changed into an organic lesion. l

our. In abdominal diseases, the nerves are sympathetically
affected belone they produce organic lesions in the ¹riscera to
which they run. l am acquainted with many instances of'indu- r
