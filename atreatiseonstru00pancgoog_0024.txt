though there are other filaments inosculated withbranches from

vessel towards the arteria innominata, and increase the numberto
about thirteen.

The internal, collected at first into abroad fasciculus through the
intervention os loose cellular tissue, soon separate aa they advance,
are spread upon the arteria innominata, and receive the external
branchos the superficial cardias necve near the origin of the
primitive carotidz Alter which alarge plexiform loop is formed
· round the subclavian, innominata and primitive carotidarteries,
and the trachea, proceeding from within as it were towards the
suriaco, to which the name os cordiae plexus is given.

In order to furnish a complete history ol the cardiac plexus, it
will he necessary now to repeat the description os the superficial
cardiac nerve given above(§. 11.) For repetitions are by no means
objectionable when they diminish the obscurity os a subject
