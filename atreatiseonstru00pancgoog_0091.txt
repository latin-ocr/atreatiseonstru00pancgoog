which notwithstanding emitted no sign of pain. I bave ano
made some experimento in younger animala, principally puppies .
and dogs, which 1 destroyed shortly after birth by a wound in
the medulla spinalis, -in order to illustrate the following question 3
whether the interooslal nerves when excited bya foreign stimu-
lant, do ordo not produce a movement in the organa submitted '⁷
to their control? Iearefully destroyed these animale, before 1
experimented upon the nervos, lept the unnatural movements
which the suffering animals should exhibit before lise was err·²
tinet, might disturb the phenomena to be observed in the nerves.
But though every precaution was lairen, nothing new was dis·
covered in confirmation of the question.

I applied the wires to the intereostal nerve in these quadru-
peda, which was united to tho par vagum in the cervical region:
I exeited from thence the beart, stomacb, and intestines: no mo-
tion followed in these organs. The heartI confess contracted,
but it was spontaneously‚ and without the application of any irri-
tant3 peristaltio contractioris of the intestines were also seen to ·
occur, but these were produced by the conieci of air, and not by
the galvanio agent sent into the nerves.

A rare opportunity was afforded me of experimenting on ι
human foetus, the skuli of which had been broken, and the brain
protruded and almost destroyed duringa severe and difficult la-
bour. The museles quivered, the beart trembled, and the intes-
tines stiffened from the simple oontaot of the air: buton arming .
the sympathetic with the wire, and applying galvanism in the ·
usual manner, there was exeited no phenomenon in the organa
which were capable of motion3 whilst‚ on the contrary, the cere·
bral nervos when irritated, produced vivid muscular contractioris.
