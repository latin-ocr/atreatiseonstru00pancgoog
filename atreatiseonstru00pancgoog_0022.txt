nal carotid artery, which they invest in various ways, attend in
every direction, and are finally spent in filaments to their tunics.
Moreover all these ramifieations, the course and complexity of
which are diversified with accessory filarncnts from the glosso-
pharyngeal nerve, and the pharyngeal and laryngeal branehes of
the eighth pair, likewise form 3 long plexus, which hasbeen di-
vided by Haller into pharyngeal and laryngeal, of which some-
· times one and sometimes the other is more strongly developed.

511. The fourth and last braneh from the superior cervical
ganglion, which is long and slender, deseends along the carotid
artery, to the aorta. Itis known by the name of the superficial
cardiae nerve, and is usually formed in part by the par vagum,
or in other words is formed by a root from each. In a ease
which 1 examined with close attention to this subject, it was
formed (on the right side) hya delicate branch from the par
vagum near the laryngeal nerve, which was (prickly strength-
ened by nervous substance coming off under the form of 3 dia-
phanous filament from the ganglion. The superficial cardiac
nerve thus formed, was connected with the par vagum, upon a
level with the fourth cervical vertebra by 3 transverse filamont
· lt theu plunged into the middle cervical ganglion, and being
again increased in size, advaneed at once to the arteria inno-
minata, and having supplied some filaments to that antony, anas·
‚amaad with a branch from the par vagum, 3ηά formed a plexus
which was connected to the great cardiac plexus, as will be ex-
plained below.

ᾧ 12. The second ganglion of the intercostal nerve, called as
I have said, thyroid or middle cervical, is six lines long 3ηά
four broad, and situated two lines above the inferior thyroid ar-
* tery. It has a long and very delicate communicating braneh
with the fourth cervical nerve, 3ηά another larger one with the
fifth. These branchos are the most superficial. Two other
branchos also exist, which pass out deeply from the sarne gang-
lion. The former of these is soit 3ηά succulent, very conspicu-
ous, and perforatas the musculae space between the transverse
apophyseS, of the fourth 3ηά fifth cervieal vertebrae, 3ηά then
