supernumerary ganglion, but which differed somewhat lrem
the preceding, as it was placed between the filaments ol the
splanehnic nerve, from some ef which it was formed. The
ganglion ef the right side, six lines long, and two lines thick,
gave eff three branches; two ef which penebating inte the abdo·
men, temrinated iu the semilunar ganglien: the third passed into
the superior mesenteric plexus. On the lest side, the supernu-
merary ganglion, was only two lines long, and one thick. The
semilunar ganglion ef the same side was indurated, aad redden
than usual.

semilunar, but osten of an irregular, variable form, situated
upon the crura ol the diaphragm, between the capsula renalis,
and the aona Instead ol ene large ganglion‚ wc frequently lind

nerve was immediately eonvertcd in an inextricable and almost
indescribable manner, into a purely nervous netwerk, ie which
eleven smeller ganglia, could be counted, spread eut in a broad
arrhae. Whatever is the arrangement os these enlargements ol
tlte splonchnie nervo, there is always a connection tlrrough the
medium ol hansverse branchos, between the two longer ganglia
el each side, which forms hat singular and intricate netwerk,
called the caeliae or solur plenus, because branehes emanata
srom it inte different regienses the body, like rays frern the sun.

The organs which receive branchos from the solar plexus, are
the diaphragrn, stemaeh, livor, spleen, small and large intestines,
kidneys, suprarenal capsules, and the spermatic vessels in both
sexes For all these nervos there is ene general and invariable
law, that their branehcs always accompany tho arterias.
