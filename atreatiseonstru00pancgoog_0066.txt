Eachganglion according to this author is composed of two
substancesp one primary, os a medullary-white: the other second·
ary, pulpy,·oellular, os arcddish-ash colour, now admitted and.
described by other anatomists, and especially hy Anaxanunn
Moneo* the Son.

-Thedormor is seen compressed into cords 3ηά filaments in the
same way as in other nerves, and is os the same character: this is
proved, lst-by the course· os each medullary filament being con·
tinued intothe ganglia itsels3 ad by the external figure and co-
lour3 sd by chemical experimenta, in which the medullary fila·
ments-os the ganglia are dissolved in a·- solution os caustic alkali,
inthe s'ame way-as the medulla ol the brain. N evertheless these
medullary ¹filamentn when they enter thc ganglia-part immediate·
Iy with their neurilema ·

'Phe latter constitutes a singular clastic cellular texture, with
innumerable minute'vesicles and cancelli, and surrounding the
whole compages of the -medullary filaments of the ganglion.
This substance, which does not wholly derive its-red colour

from tlie sanguiferous vessels, surrounds the filaments in the
ganglia of the sympathetic nervo, and is more tenacious than in
the spinal ganglia, where it is looser, and is lost sight of. It
acquiresavery great consistency and tenacity in the semilunar
gnrglia3 from which the investigation and anatomical analysis
of these bodies is attended with great difficulty.

§Ba-tl will-now narrate with candour, my own observations in
> relation to the internalt s tructure of the ganglia

The bes tmethod os investigatingt athe structureos the ganglia,
accoridng to Rurscn, 3ηά Sonam, 1s by maceration 1n simple
water Well accustomed to this operation, Iaffixed the ganglia
to a wooden table, and by washlng them daily with fresh limpid
water, reduced them into tomentose globules, in which the con·
ditior cf the minutest filaments were best seen, especially when
the nerves were thrown upon an ebony plata, which rendered
the nervous fibrils more conspicuously white. '¹
