occasional causes of this discsse, as well as the sudden occurrence
Ι of its paroxysms, most clearly evinco a dynamio affection ottho
nervos. I know very well that in the bodies ol those who have
died with this disease, osseous incrustations are often discovered
at the origin of the aorta and pulmonary arterias, in the semilunar
valves, in the callous ring which separatos the cavities of the
ventricles¹ and auriolos, and frequently in the tunics ol tho ooro·
nary artery. But in my opinion, these phenomena are the el·
fecta only, and in no wise the causes of this disease, since they
have been found in many individuale who did not die under any
form ol angina pectoris, and were never subjected to its attacks.

When, however, such ossifioations are met with in this disease,
we may clearly comprehend their mode ol productior, if we re-
call to mind the jurisdiction which the nervos exorciso over the
vessels to which belong the functione ol nutrition: sor the ner-
vous filaments act upon the capillary vessels, the fonctions of
which they elevate, when the latter, thus soroed into an unusual
manner of action, gives origin to a peculiar substance, in the
texture of the above named portione of the heart. It is well
known by every cultivator of pathological anatomy, that the
fibrous texture os whiol the arteries are compared, is very easily
penetrated by the phosphate of lime.

As to the remote cause os angina pectoris,I do ¹not imagine
that it is always to be found in the arthritio diathesis; and I
know not why we should refuso te believe in the existence os
any other pernicious powers, capable of producing injury in the
¹cardiao nervos. 'I'he celebrated Wrworrraan* moreover essens,
that there were no perceptible symptoms of arthritio in the caseo
⁸ol angina pectoris which he had notioed.†
