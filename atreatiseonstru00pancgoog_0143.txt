the ganglia, which Ι then only, distinctly and satisfactorily ob-
served for the first time, formed, in the case of this female, a
chronic affection, which had been gradually increasing in inten-

nervous and hypochondriacal affections, the excruciating, but

plexus in diseases in which I suspected an affection of the abdo-
minal nerves, aad where spasmodic symptoms had existed either
in the viscera os the thorax or epigastrium.

seized with epidemic pertussis, which was hrst converted by
metastasis into a spasmodic vomiting of three days continuanee,
and finally degenerated into an incurable form ol clonic convul-

Ι found the whole left part of the solar plexus in this caseinflam·

have been only accidentally red, I immersed the plexus fer a few

days in pure water. At the end of this period, although the red-
