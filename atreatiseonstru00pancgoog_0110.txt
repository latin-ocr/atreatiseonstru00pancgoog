How this discriminat tion can be correc tly established, Iud

sore it is again called into action. Hungeritseli does notdepend
upon the vacuity os the stomoch solely; it ³ is on unpleosant sen·

nor evolution. The spermattc and uterine nerves which ore
given off from the sympathetic, seem to have acquired no power
