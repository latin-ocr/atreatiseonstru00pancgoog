panico the hcpatic artory‚ consisting of about soron thick round
strong and reddish branchos, two or throe of which aro connected '
with the right semilunar ganglion.

Before these branchos, properly called tho nervi comites of
the hcpatic artmy, roooh the livor, a fasciculus of fivc or more
branchos from this plexus, descends with tho right guafra-duo·
denal artery, to the ponoreas and duodenum.

Of the nervos properly called hcpatic, one conspicuous trunk
divided in three branchos, extends to tho duetus oholodochus,
upon which it is spent, whilst tho remaindor, passing through
the portae of tho livor, follow tho branchos of tho hcpatic artory,

The posterior, arises chiefly from tho right semilunar ganglion,

with tho branchos of the vessels.

The anterior hcpatic plexus is therefore composed chiefly, lat,
of the right par vagum (funiculus stomachicus dexter); ad, of
that part of the salar plexus which is derived from tho left semi-
lunar ganglion3 and sd, partly of filamonts from the right semi·
lunar ganglion.

Tho posterior hcpatic plexus is formed almost entirely from
the right ganglion.

It is known in a general way, that tho nervos distributod to
tho livor, belong priuoipolly to tho artorios which they accom-
