have the same structure as the cerebral and spinal nerves,¹ the
same plexisorm division, and when examined with the micro·
scope, the same composition3 to wit, medulla and neurileme

On the other hand, Ι know from attentive observation, that
the sympathetio nerve transmits the impressions it receives, to
the common censorium, in the same manner as the cerebra] and
spinal nerves. Thus an irritant afflicting the primae viae is per· ·
ceived immediately by the hrain, as the following demonstrates3 ,
lat, The tormina occurring in various diseases3 ad, A calculus
lodging in the biliary ducts, the pelvis of the kidueys or the
ureters3 sd, An irritant near the hepatia plexus, from which an
animal was seen to suffer by Hennam* 4th, The galvanio agent
producing intense peristaltic motion, and secretion os the intes·

Perhaps my opponente may urge against this view the impo-
tence of the sympathetic nervo in transmitting the commanda of
the¹ will to the organs to which its branches run. But do there
not also exist cerebra] nerves in which this power has no ex·
istcnce? The action os the stomach is not subverted by the de-
termination of the will alone, though it receives cerebral branches3
the contraction os the diaphragm and abdomina] muscles, cannot
be restrained in attempts to vomit in tussis, nor in the final
periodtof parturition. The will does not govern the iris, al-
though the movements of the latter depend upon the irritationes
the retina. 0n the other hand, the physiological experimenta
cited above, prove that the contractioris of the heart may be ex-
cited by the nerves. -

Other arguments will subsequently by adduoed which tend to
show the analogy, or rather parity between the two nervous sys-
tema, in regard to the vital powers with which they are ondow-
ed, and the functione they exercise.

For we have discovered [ξ 107.] that in the inferior verte·
chased, and some invertebrated animala, by turns the sympathe-
tie nerve aud par vagum are incompleta, or entirely wanting, but
