cortic renuide, an osseous scale, an inch in length, with spin-
our processes projecting toward the base ol the heart, and situat-
ed in the sulcus which separatas the right ventriclc from the'
aumcle In dissecting out the anterior coronary plexus, 1 found
,its branches completely surrounded this scale, and by whichI
have no doubt, they were much irritated in extraordinary move·

died from hectic lever aiter congestion os the lunga, l found the
principal cardiac nerve of the right side, tamid, reddish, and
ganglilorm, near the baseos the heart, for a space of eighteen
lines, and two anda half broad, exhibiting a blackish point in
the middle3 this enlargement differed from the true ganglion in
this respect, that it was soster, and when pressed with the linger

ξ 150. The inflammation peculiar to the nerves of which we
treated (ς lto-143) differs from that, which seems only to be
communicated to them. by the phlogosis of neighbouring parts:
ior in this case the redness of the nerves is leis intense, and dis·

In a very violent case of pleurisy which Ι dissected, the first
thoracic ganglion was neither increased in size, or density; hut
upon its suriace there wasa red vascular networlr, elegantly de·

veloped. The redness did not in this case extend into the cen· ,

tral structure ol the ganglion, which when cut in two, appeared
of the same colour as the other ganglia that were perfectly
healthy. The same fact, with little variation, was noticed in the
nerves of the intestines ·

Part of ¹the jejunum, contained in a hernial sac where it was
incarcerated, exhibited the deepest inflammation in all its tunica,
as well asin the mesentery. I eagerly embraced this opportu-

whether they were in such cases, in a state of inflammation or
