ln the cavity of the chest, the branches preserve a similar cha-
racter and condition.

But how' great ιι the diversity' ιιι the abdomen ιιι regcrd to the , Ι
Χ nature of the plexuses, and their relitim'to the vessels! 1 have
been taught byan attedtive examinationes the abdomina] nervas,

that there isadiversity ιιι every plexus, arising from the semi· ¹

The splemc plexus agrees more with the gastric.. The branch-
lets of these plexuses indeed, envelope the arterias, bpt without
closely adhering to them. ,· ι .

The contrary is observed' m the superiorhresenteric plexum ,
the filamenta of which adhere so tenaciously ιο the tmnls, and
the larger branches given off from' it, thatwe cannot without some
’ force pull them munder, the small branches are lils'ewise so in· ’
terconnected, that they rather constitute a nervous membrane, as
there rs a distinct network ιιι the places between them

The inferior mesenteric plexus adheres less often to its subja·
cent artery Βιιι ιι maybe observed generally, respecting thess
plexuses, that the nervous branches are united closely to tho
trunks only, and the beginning or origin of the branchos: to the
smaller branches they adhere more loosely,or rather run parallel
with them. ⁰ ¹

‘A great difference exista also between the mesenteric plexuses,
and the renal plexus, which corresponds with the hepatic in this,
that its branches are thicher, more succulent, red, and not unsre·
quently mixed with ganglia, which 1 have never observed in the
splenio and mesenteric plexuses. ¹

The hypogaetric plexus in fine appears ιο meos all the most
dry and firm, particularly where the roots assemble from either

side, to form a broad trunlr, placed in the middle ol the sacrum.
