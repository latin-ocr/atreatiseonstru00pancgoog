-in which the lungs become red and slightly indurated, and which
from its similarity in appearance tn the spleen‚ should Ι think

tubercles, of which the largest was the sine of an orange, and tha
smallest that of a cherry stone: The whole weighed nine pounds
after the hearthad been separated. All the tubercles were lorm-
ed ol a matter resembling the foetal brain, not enclosed in cysts‚
but in contact with the perenchyma which was perfectly healthy.
The whole of the superior lobe of the right lung, was converted
into avast sac, filled with this pultaceous substance, with which a
massot coagulated blood was mixed. T-he pulmonary nerves,
when examined with the greatest care, were'not found tc differ
in the least from their healthy condition. They ran into, and

by calcareous tubercles which were firmly attached to the bron-
