It follows from what is predicated above, that there existen
sympathetic relation between the cephalic nervous centre and the
abdominal which though more evidently diffueed, nevertheless
converges, in some way into the aolar plexus. But frequently
this friendly communion is eo disturbed, that an antagonism
arises bet tween the two centres in the healthy state, but· which ιε · ⁸
much more obvious in the disceted. N or does this comprise all

· the phenomena developed here.

Just aa the cephalic nervous centra, is capable of being singu·
larly excited and exaltcd tc a wonderful degree of power3 ao it ie ⁰
with the other, the ganglioao·abdominal contre, which occasional-
ly breaks out from its ordinary uphem, the function of nutritiop,
'and produces extraordinary pbenomena in soma diseases, of
which I shall give a description in the following section.

which have been lately elicit'ed by the aid of animal magnetis&
and which open a new field to physiological experimenta. ”,

· Whatever may be the opinion hereafter held by judiciousmen,'
in regard to magnetic phenomena, it must be admitted that the
abdominal nervous centreis forced by the magnetic intluence into
. a new aphere of action; that, in a manner utterly unknown to u's,
its dignity is elevated to thehighest pitoh, so as to apparently as·
sume the functione of the cerebrum itself; that extraordinary
powersare manifested, of which we had before no conception
and which indeed we may wonder at, but cannot explain. Fiam
a medical friend, asagacious ohserver of nature, without any

without her knowledge upon the scrobiculos cordis. This fact
certainly gives additional weight‚ to similar observatione, which
have been long known.

1 do not think that these observatione which seem to declare the
existence of occult powers in human nature should be rejected:

and it does not become a medical philosopher in my opinioni to
